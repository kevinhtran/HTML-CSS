  <h1>Captain America</h1>
  <blockquote>“Doesn't matter what the press says. Doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right.</blockquote>
  <p>This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter
  the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant
  yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world -- "No, YOU move.”</p>
