<p>My name is Kevin Tran and this has been a long journey into the coding world. As of recently, everything in my programming world has been unraveled and given me the sense of what it takes to become a successful programmer. With aspirations and sheer discipline, My ultimate goal is to become a god-tier Front-End Web Developer. My dream and passion now lays here in web development. My stack is Javascript and nothing else. <strong>LETS GET IT!</strong></p>
